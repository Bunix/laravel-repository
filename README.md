Main Features
-------------


### Simplify caching strategies and buy time

Implementing high availability and concurrency caching strategies could be a complex and time consuming task without the appropiate abstraction layer.

Laravel Model Repository simplifies caching strategies using human-readable chained methods for your existing Eloquent models :)


### Save cache storage and money

Current available methods for caching Laravel models store the entire PHP object in cache. That consumes a lot of extra storage and results in slower response times, therefore having a more expensive infrastructure.

Laravel Model Repository stores only the business specific data of your model in order to recreate exactly the same instance later (after data being loaded from cache). Saving more than 50% of cache storage and significantly reducing response times from the cache server.

<br>

Installation
------------
Make sure you have properly configured a cache connection and driver in your Laravel/Lumen project. You can find cache configuration instructions for Laravel at https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/cache and for Lumen at https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/6.x/cache

### Install the package via Composer

```bash
$ composer require krazydanny/laravel-repository
```

<br>

Creating a Repository for a Model
---------------------------------	

In order to simplify caching strategies we will encapsulate model access within a model repository.

Two parameters are required by the constructor. The first parameter is the model's full class name. The second parameter is the prefix to be used in cache to store model data.


```php
namespace App\Repositories;

use App\User;
use KrazyDanny\Eloquent\Repository;

class UserRepository extends Repository {

	public function __construct ( ) {

		parent::__construct(
			User::class, // Model's class name
			'Users' // the name of the cache prefix
		);
	}
}

```

<br>


Use with Singleton Pattern
--------------------------

As a good practice to improve performance and keep your project simple is strongly recommended to use repositories along with the singleton pattern, avoiding the need for creating separate instances for the same repository at different project levels.

First register the singleton call in a service provider:

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use App\Repositories\UserRepository;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {

    public function register ( ) {

        $this->app->singleton( 
           UserRepository::class, 
            function () {
                return (new UserRepository);
            }
        );
    }

    # other service provider methods here
}

```

Add a line like this on every file you call the repository in order to keep code clean and pretty ;)

```php
use App\Repositories\UserRepository;

```

Then access the same repository instance anywhere in your project :)

```php
$userRepository = app( UserRepository::class );

```

<br>

Calling built-in Eloquent methods
---------------------------------

Calling native Eloquent Model methods from our repository gives us the advantage of combining them with caching strategies. First, let's see how we call them. It's pretty straightforward :)


Create a new model:
```php
$user = app( UserRepository::class )->create([
	'firstname' => 'Krazy',
	'lastname'  => 'Danny',
	'email'	    => 'somecrazy@email.com',
	'active'    => true,
]);

$user_id = $user->getKey();

```


Get a specific model by ID:
```php
$user = app( UserRepository::class )->get( $user_id );

```


Update a specific model:
```php
$user->active = false;

app( UserRepository::class )->save( $user );

```


Delete a specific model:
```php
app( UserRepository::class )->delete( $user );

```

<br>


Making Eloquent Queries
-----------------------

Unlike get() or save(), query methods work a little different. They receive as parameter the desired query builder instance (Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder) in order to execute the query.

This will allow us to combine queries with caching strategies, as we will cover forward on this document. For now let's focus on the query methods only. For example:

To find all models under a certain criteria:
```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

$userCollection = app( UserRepository::class )->find( $q );

```

To get the first model instance under a certain criteria:
```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

$user = app( UserRepository::class )->first( $q );

```

To count all model instances under a certain criteria:
```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

$userCount = app( UserRepository::class )->count( $q );

```

<br>


Caching methods overview
------------------------

### remember() & during()

Calling remember() before any query method like find(), first() or count() stores the query result in cache for a given time. Always followed by the during() method, which defines the duration of the results in cache (TTL/Time-To-Live in seconds)


```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

app( UserRepository::class )->remember()->during( 3600 )->find( $q );

```


Also a model instance could be passed as parameter in order to store that specific model in cache.


```php
app( UserRepository::class )->remember( $user )->during( 3600 );

```



### rememberForever()

Calling rememberForever() before any query method like find(), first() or count() stores the query result in cache without an expiration time.


```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

app( UserRepository::class )->rememberForever()->find( $q );

```


Also a model instance could be passed as parameter in order to store that specific model in cache without expiration.


```php
app( UserRepository::class )->rememberForever( $user );

```


### forget()

This method removes one or many models (or queries) from cache. It's very useful when you update a model and need cached queries or dependencies to be refreshed in real time.

The first parameter must be an instance of the model, a specific model ID (primary key) or a query builder instance (Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder).


Forget query results
```php
$query = User::where( 'active', true );

app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $query );

```

Forget a specific model using the object
```php
app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $userModelInstance );

```

Forget a specific model by id
```php
app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $user_id );

```

The second parameter (optional) could be an array to queue forget() operations in order to be done in a single request to the cache server. 

When passed the forget() method appends to the array (by reference) the removal operations instead of sending them instantly to the cache server.

It's useful when you need to expire many cached queries or models of the same repository. You can do it in one request optimizing response times for your cache server, therefore your app :)

For example:
```php
$user->active = false;
$user->save();

$forgets = [];

#removes user model from cache
app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $user, $forgets );

#removes query that finds active users
$query = User::where( 'active', true );
app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $query, $forgets );

#requests all queued removals to the cache server
app( UserRepository::class )->forget( $forgets );

```

<br>


Implementing Caching Strategies
-------------------------------

### Read-Aside Cache

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Read Aside Caching" src="https://github.com/krazydanny/laravel-repository/blob/master/read-aside-cache.png">
</p>

**How it works?**

1. The app first looks the desired model or query in the cache. If the data is found in cache, weâ€™ve cache hit. The model or query results are read and returned to the client without database workload at all.
2. If model or query results were not found in cache we have a cache miss, then data is retrieved from database.
3. Model or query results retrived from database are stored in cache in order to have a successful cache hit next time.

**Use cases**

Works best for heavy read workload scenarios and general purpose.


**Usage**


When detecting you want a model or query to be remembered in cache for a certain period of time, Laravel Repository Model will automatically first try to retrieve it from cache. If it doesn't will automatically retrieve it from database and store it in cache for the next time :)


Get a specific model by ID:
```php
$user = app( UserRepository::class )->remember()->during( 3600 )->get( $user_id );

```

Execute a query:
```php
$q = User::where( 'active', true );

$userCollection = app( UserRepository::class )->remember()->during( 3600 )->find( $q );

```
